What can you do to be part of this?

You can either become a Cloud4Edge Operator or a Cloud4Edge Pilot, or both of course.

Cloud4Edge Operators acquire and deploy Gener8 datacenter units. Gener8, pronounced as the verb generate, is the brand name of the actual hyper-converged grid nodes that, in analogy to energy/power generators, generate IT capacity. This storage and compute capacity can then be used for your own private cloud workloads, unused capacity will be bought back for consumption by others needing capacity in your area.

As a Cloud4Edge Operator you get paid back on a monthly basis for a minimum contractually agreed capacity. More capacity can be resold through Cloud4Edge Pilots.

Cloud4Edge Pilots are actually virtual datacenter operators, aggregating IT capacity from one or more Cloud4Edge Operators, selling IaaS, PaaS and SaaS to others, directly to customers or indirectly through system integrators or value added cloud providers.  

Cloud4Edge Pilots will get a minimal contractual agreed capacity from the grid, free of charge. It is up to them on how they will want to use it. If more capacity is needed, Cloud4Edge Pilots will work with one or more Cloud4Edge operators, typically local to the targeted end customer.
