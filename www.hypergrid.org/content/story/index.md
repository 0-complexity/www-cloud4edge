The internet. Remember how it all started? With universities and companies individually connecting many independent networks, collaborating and freely sharing knowledge.

<b>And where are we now?</b>

The internet evolved into huge energy-hungry datacenters, owned by a few, mainly US headquartered companies, that are racing for world dominance by capturing clients with sticky services, closely watched by foreign governmental intelligence agencies seeking access to your data. Command and control.

With the fourth industrial revolution starting, in a world that has become as much dependent on IT as on energy, IT should become as energy:
* At the edge, instead of in large datacenters, owned by a few giants. Distributed in a global grid and delivered from local branches close to you, owned by many;
* True commodity, affordable and accessible to all, truly reliable and fundamentally simple to use;
* Green, being eco-responsible and daring to say no to huge inefficient datacenters.

<i>This is what we call IT as Energy.</i>

### To the Edge
Delivering IT at the edge comes down to deploying a geo-scale, hyper-distributed grid of multiple thousands of intelligently interconnected cloud nodes, each of them as close as possible to their users. At all times data will be owned by the users and under their full control. The nodes themselves need to be self-healing, only requiring minimal intervention by the local operator. 

### True Commodity
True commodity is achieved by constantly questioning design, avoiding and eliminating any form of unnecessary complexity, keeping it simple and as a result very cost-effective. Commodity also requires ultra reliable storage of all data. Just as with electricity data should always be available, close to the user, wherever he goes. Something that can only be achieved using a modern geo-scale storage architecture.

### Totally Green
Most energy-friendly efforts today are focused on how energy is generated. At least as much can be realized by optimizing how energy is consumed, simply by using less hardware for delivering the same result. This again by eliminating complexity, such as legacy and even modern software-defined abstraction levels and instead keep as close to bare metal as possible. Also using more effective storage algorithms results in less disks for the same or even better reliability and a hyper-converged approach translates into lower energy consumption for equal and often better value.
