How to become an affiliated partner?

You can either become a Cloud4Edge Operator or a Cloud4Edge Pilot, or both.

Cloud4Edge Operators acquire and deploy G8 cloud units to generate IT capacity, in analogy to energy/power generators. This storage and compute capacity can then be used for your own private cloud workloads, spare capacity is offered to Cloud4Edge so affialted partners offer capacity to their respective markets.

As a Cloud4Edge Operator you get paid on a monthly basis for a minimum contractually agreed capacity.

Cloud4Edge Pilots are actually virtual cloud providers, aggregating IT capacity from one or more Cloud4Edge Operators, selling IaaS, PaaS and SaaS to others, directly to customers or indirectly through resellers and value added cloud providers.  

Cloud4Edge Pilots will get a minimal contractual agreed capacity from the grid, free of charge. It is up to them on how they will want to use it. If more capacity is needed, Cloud4Edge Pilots will work with one or more Cloud4Edge operators, typically local to the targeted end customer.
