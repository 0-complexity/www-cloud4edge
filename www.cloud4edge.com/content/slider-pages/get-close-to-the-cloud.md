## To the Edge

We believe in a new kind of cloud, which is not centralized in large and power-hungry datacenters. We are building an alternative by connecting eco-friendly and powerful cloud generators with our cloud community partners offering IT capacity local to the users and developers.

### Cloud4Edge is Hyper-Distributed

Characteristics of a hyper-distributed cloud are following: 

* IT workloads can run locally on customer site, or in the nearest available cloud generator
* Different cloud generators are connected and form a grid to distribute data and workloads
* The data is 100% available, even when one or more cloud generators are not operating

### Cloud4Edge is Secure, Neutral and Private

Creating a public cloud alternative without backdoors in a democratized community.

* Secure as no third party software is licensed into the cloud generators
* Neutral community with an advisory board protecting the values of Cloud4Edge
* Cloud operators can also decide to keep the IT capacity 100% private for own purpose 

### Cloud4Edge is Self-Healing

The cloud operators that generate cloud capacity are hands-off:

* The installed cloud generators are autonomous by design
* The software algorithms create an ultra-reliable storage platform
* Data never needs backup and the virtual machines have an unlimited amount of snapshots
