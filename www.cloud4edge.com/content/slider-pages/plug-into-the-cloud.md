## True Commodity

We believe IT should be as available and accessible as electricity. With 15 years of experience in building the world first clouds we are now transforming the industry by simplifying and delivering the benefits of the cloud as a commodity. 

### Cloud4Edge is Cost-Effective

We have eliminated a lot of technology layers to realize our cloud generators.

* Robust and eco-friendly hardware, no premium hardware
* Minimal consumption of electricity to power the clouds
* Driven by open source, without the need to license software

### Cloud4Edge is Comprehensive

We have simplified the user interfaces and are creating a user experience that is fast and real-time

* Easy-to-use
* No complexity
* Fully transparent

### Cloud4Edge is Ultra-Reliable

By design the cloud generators are stand-alone clustered, while connected to the grid, it distributes data

* Data is always available
* Outages do not impact the service
* No backups or disaster recovery software needed
