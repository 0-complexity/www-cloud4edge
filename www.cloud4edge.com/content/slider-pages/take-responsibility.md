## Totally Green

We believe that all of us should take responsibility to reduce the consumption of energy, while the world continous to digitize. Say no to power-hungry datacenters as alternatives are available.

### Cloud4Edge is Build with the Most Effective Storage Software Algorithms

Unique technology that has been developed in the last 15 years 

* Data protection by design
* No need for backups
* Geographical spread of data

### Cloud4Edge Uses a Minimal of Hardware

We are creating the grid using commodity hardware, and only power cloud nodes when users onboard.

* Extremely scalable both on performance as well as storage
* A single cloud generator can host 600 virtual machines
* The storage cluster is scalable to hundreds of petabytes

### Cloud4Edge is Fast and Scalable

The two-tier architecture of the cloud generators allows us to both scale compute and storage.

* SSD storage to handle active workloads
* Connecting cloud generators enables geo-scalability
* We can deliver millions of IOPS from a single cloud cluster
